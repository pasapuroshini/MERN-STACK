## **Understanding Version Control**  

### **What is Version Control?**
- A method to manage and track changes in a project.  
- Examples:  
  - Writing a book, developing software, creating videos, etc.  
- **Problem**: Making updates or edits can overwrite previous work.

### **How Version Control Helps**  
1. Saves different versions of your project.  
2. Allows reverting to a previous version if needed.  
3. Ensures updates don't overwrite old files.  

#### Example: 
- Writing chapters of a book:  
  - Save Chapter 1, then Chapter 2, and so on.  
  - Keep multiple saves to avoid data loss.  
- In software projects:  
  - Developers used to create folders like `QuizApp1`, `QuizApp2`, `QuizAppFinal`, etc.

## **Version Control Systems (VCS)**
- Tools designed to manage versions and facilitate collaboration.  

### **Types of VCS**
1. **Local Version Control**:  
   - Saves versions on your local machine.  
   - **Problems**:  
     - No collaboration features.  
     - Data is lost if the local machine fails.  

2. **Centralized Version Control (CVCS)**:  
   - A central server stores all versions.  
   - Team members access and commit to the central server.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Everyone has access to the latest changes.  
   - **Disadvantages**:  
     - Single point of failure: If the server goes down, data is lost.  

3. **Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**:  
   - **Features**:  
     - Local copies contain the entire project history.  
     - Remote repositories store backups.  
   - **Advantages**:  
     - Local copies enable offline work.  
     - No reliance on a single server.  

---

## **Git: A Distributed Version Control System**
- **Key Features**:  
  1. Local and remote copies with full history.  
  2. Collaboration tools to work with others.  
  3. Examples of remote repositories: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.  

- **Why Git?**  
  - Offline work is possible.  
  - Enables collaboration with full project history.

# Version Control
Version control is a process that tracks and manages changes to software code or documents over time.
A version control system (VCS) tracks changes to files, allowing developers to collaborate and return to earlier versions. VCSs are essential for efficient software development. 
# Types of version control System:

Having power  to go back to previous versions -> Git
need to use some system  features to achieve version control -> version control system.

Git is fully distributed.

# Open Source Projects and the Evolution of Git

## **Open Source vs. Proprietary Projects**  
- **Proprietary Projects**:  
  - Limited team members working within a company.  
  - Trust is established among team members.  

- **Open Source Projects**:  
  - Anyone in the world can contribute.  
  - Collaboration is inclusive and global.

---

## **Open Source Contributions**  
1. **Process**:  
   - Understand the project.  
   - Propose new features.  
   - Contribute code.  

2. **Example**:  
   - Adding a Bluetooth connectivity module to an open-source OS.  

3. **Sharing Code**:  
   - Initially done using archive files or patches.

---

## **Linux & Early Version Control**  
- **1991-2002**: Contributions to the Linux kernel were managed manually using patches or archive files.  
- **2002**: The Linux community adopted **BitKeeper** for efficient contributions.  
- **Challenges with BitKeeper**:  
  - Licensing policy changes introduced costs.  
  - Led the community to create an alternative system.

---

## **Birth of Git (2005)**  
- Git was created as an alternative to BitKeeper.  
- Designed to address the unique needs of open-source collaboration.  

### **Key Features of Git**  
- **Simplicity**: Easy to learn and use.  
- **Speed**: Efficient performance for small and large projects.  
- **Branching**: Supports multiple development workflows.  
- **Distributed Architecture**: Enables seamless collaboration worldwide.

---

## **Why Git is Special**  
- Distinct from earlier version control systems.  
- Suitable for both open-source and proprietary projects.  
- Branching (covered later) simplifies and enhances development workflows.
